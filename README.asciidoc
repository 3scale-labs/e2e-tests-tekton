= End-to-end Tests with Tekton Pipelines

This repo currently holds a basic proof of concept for a
https://www.openshift.com/learn/topics/pipelines[tekton] pipeline, which:

* Creates a new openshift project
* Deploys 3scale from the 3scale-operator
* Runs some end-to-end tests
* Tears down the created openshift project

== Pre-requisites

* Tekton pipelines should be installed. e.g. with `make tekton` (probably requires `cluster-admin`
permissions)

== Usage

0.Ensure you have installed the pre-requisites

1. `make install`, to install the pipeline in a new openshift project
1. `make run` to trigger a PipelineRun of the installed pipeline




# TODO

* check out 3scale/3scale-operator repo
** what version of this? master? from github?
* make push-manifest to some quay.io application repo, with some unique packagename
** https://quay.io/application/3scale/operator_master
* [.line-through]#create OperatorSource to point to that application repo#
* [.line-through]#install operator from OperatorSource#
