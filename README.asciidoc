= End-to-end Tests with Tekton Pipelines

This repo currently holds a basic proof of concept for a
https://www.openshift.com/learn/topics/pipelines[tekton] pipeline, which:

* Creates a new openshift project
* Deploys 3scale from the 3scale-operator
* Runs some end-to-end tests
* Tears down the created openshift project

== Pre-requisites

* Tekton pipelines should be installed. e.g. with `make tekton` (probably requires `cluster-admin`
permissions)

== Usage

0.Ensure you have installed the pre-requisites

1. `make install`, to install the pipeline in a new openshift project
1. `make run` to trigger a PipelineRun of the installed pipeline
